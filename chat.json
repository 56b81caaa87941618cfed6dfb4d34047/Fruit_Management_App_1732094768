The contract inherits from OpenZeppelin's ERC20 and Ownable contracts.\n2. The constructor initializes the token with the name \"Minting Token\" and symbol \"MTK\".\n3. A mint function is implemented that allows the owner to create new tokens and assign them to a specified address.\n4. An event TokensMinted is emitted when tokens are minted for transparency.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n- The contract doesn't have a maximum supply cap. If you want to limit the total supply, you should add this functionality.\n- Only the contract owner can mint tokens. If you need different minting permissions, you should modify the access control.\n\nTo deploy and interact with this contract:\n1. Deploy the contract. No constructor arguments are needed.\n2. The deploying address will be the owner and the only address able to mint tokens.\n3. To mint tokens, call the mint function with the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to mint.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test the contract before deploying it to a live network.\n",

Added a totalStaked variable to track the total amount of tokens staked.\n3. Implemented a setRewardRate function to allow the owner to update the reward rate.\n4. Added appropriate events for all state-changing functions.\n5. Implemented a getTotalStaked function to retrieve the total staked amount.\n\nCaveats and assumptions:\n1. The contract assumes the staking token has 18 decimals. Adjust the rewardRate if this is not the case.\n2. The initial staking token address is set to a placeholder. Make sure to change it before deployment or use the setStakingToken function after deployment.\n\nTo deploy and interact with the contract:\n1. Deploy the contract.\n2. Call setStakingToken to set the correct staking token address.\n3. Users can then stake tokens using the stake function, withdraw using the withdraw function, and claim rewards using the getReward function.\n4. The owner can adjust the reward rate using the setRewardRate function if needed.\n\nMake sure to approve the contract to spend the staking tokens before calling the stake function.\n",
