It also displays the current state of the contract (airdrop executed and query hash) and provides status messages for user feedback.\n\nPlease note that this component assumes the presence of an Ethereum provider (like MetaMask) in the browser. Also, for security reasons, it's recommended to use environment variables for sensitive information like contract addresses in a production environment.\n\nThe component uses Tailwind CSS for styling as requested. You may need to adjust the styling to fit your specific design requirements.\n",
